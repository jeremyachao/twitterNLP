# TwitterNLP

Some NLP using Tweepy to analyse live sentiments given a key word. This uses multiple algorithms and a voting system to produce the msot comprehensive output. Credits to pythonprogramming.net for the inspiring tutorial.

First make sure you have twitter dev credentials and put them into twittertest.py!

Steps to run:

1. Run twitterNLP.py to generate pickled algos (this may take awhile to train)
2. Run twittertest.py 
3. Run twitterplot.py to see a matplot generated graph of the live sentiment analysis
